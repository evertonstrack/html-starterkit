HTML-starterkit
========

My personal lightweight starterkit for a frontend project.


Features
========

- Extremely lightweight, semantic HTML5 framework;
- [Normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/) included;
- Htaccess (Boilerplane custom);
- Web Accessibility initiative (WAI-ARIA);
- Media queries for main resolutions;
- Google Analytics snippet;
- Grunt for build tasks (minify styles/scripts, caching control);


Required (for grunt features)
========

Install [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/).
Open a command terminal window in the project folder and run the following command to install the necessary local dependencies:
```
$ npm install
```
When completed, run next command for generate build:
```
$ grunt
```

The generated build will be in the folder "/dist";
